## Stack

A stack is a data structure that temporarily stores data, following the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Stacks are commonly used in various algorithms and problems, including function calls, parenthesis matching, and postfix notation evaluation.

### Basic Concepts

- **Push**: The operation of adding an item to the top of the stack is called "push." New elements are pushed onto the stack, becoming the new top element.

- **Pop**: The operation of removing and returning the top item from the stack is called "pop." The most recently added item (the top of the stack) is removed.

- **Top**: The "top" of the stack refers to the element currently at the top. You can access the top element without removing it.

- **IsEmpty**: A stack can be checked for emptiness using the "isEmpty" operation. If the stack has no elements, it is considered empty.
