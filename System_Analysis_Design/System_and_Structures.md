## System Analysis and Design

### What is a System?
> - A system is a designed and implemented information system that transforms data into a form that can be processed by computers, stores, processes, and manipulates data, and outputs information when needed.

> #### People Involved in System Development
>
> - `Organizational Expert`, `Database Expert`, `Programmer`, `Project Manager`, `System Analyst`, `System Administrator`

### Roles of Each Development Position

| Position | Role |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **Organizational Expert** | Analyzes and improves the organization's strategy and structure, responsible for establishing ISP (Information Security Policy) plans. Develops information security policies and procedures and oversees their implementation. |
| **Database Expert** | Designs, builds, and manages database systems. Responsible for data modeling, query writing, backup, and recovery operations. |
| **Programmer** | Software developer who writes software in various programming languages and performs maintenance. |
| **Project Manager** | Leads project planning and execution, manages schedules and budgets, and organizes project teams. |
| **System Analyst** | Analyzes information systems, collects business requirements, and designs software and hardware systems. |
| **System Administrator** | Manages computer systems and networks, responsible for hardware, software, security, and performance optimization. |

### SDLC 5 Phases (Waterfall Model)
> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the process of planning, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining an information system in the fields of system engineering, information systems, or software engineering.

| Phase | Role |
|:--------:|:-------------------:|
| **Analysis** | Collect and analyze requirements, set system design goals. |
| **Design** | Develop system architecture and design. |
| **Implementation** | Write software code and develop programs. |
| **Testing** | Verify software and identify defects. |
| **Maintenance** | Update software, fix bugs, provide support, and make improvements. |

>#### Advantages and Disadvantages of SDLC Models
> - **Advantages**
>   + Each phase of system development is relatively clear.
>   + It can be applied easily as each phase has an organic relationship.
> - **Disadvantages**
>   + If development is not based on thorough analysis, problems may surface during testing or maintenance phases, leading to significant time and cost investments.
>   + In large projects, there is a high chance of external environmental or internal policy changes during a long development period, requiring costly and time-consuming changes and management of changes in previous phases.

### Prototype Model
> The prototype model creates a software prototype to understand user requirements and predict the final product.

> - **Advantages**
>   + Helps users understand the result in advance during the early stages of development.
>   + Allows for the identification of modifications and improvements at an early stage.
>   + Users can participate in the analysis and design process, providing immediate feedback.
> - **Disadvantages**
>   + Not suitable for one-time or large-scale projects.
>   + Since the prototype is created based on incomplete requirements, it ultimately produces an incomplete system, requiring significant resources and time for modification and improvement.
